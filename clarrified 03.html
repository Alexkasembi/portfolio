            <p>
                <dl>
                <h4>Project overview</h4> 
            
                
                <dd>The goal of this project is to create a high-quality annotated dataset of traffic signs for training a machine learning model used in self-driving cars.</dd>

                <dt>Steps Involved:</dt>
                <dd>1. Data Collection</dd>
                   - Collect images from various sources, such as public datasets (e.g., GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark) or capture new images using car-mounted cameras in different environments and weather conditions.
                   - Ensure diversity in the dataset by including images from urban, suburban, and rural areas, as well as varying lighting and weather conditions.
                
                <dd>2. Define Annotation Guidelines</dd>
                   - Create a detailed annotation guide that specifies how to annotate each type of traffic sign.
                   - Include examples of correctly and incorrectly annotated images to ensure consistency among annotators.
                   - Define the categories of traffic signs to be annotated (e.g., stop sign, yield sign, speed limit sign, pedestrian crossing sign).
                
                <dd>3. Annotation Tool Selection</dd>
                   - Choose an annotation tool that supports bounding box annotation and labeling, such as LabelImg, VGG Image Annotator (VIA), or a web-based tool like CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool).
                
                <dd>3. Annotation Tool Selection</dd>
                   - Annotators will draw bounding boxes around each traffic sign in the images and label them according to the predefined categories.
                   - Ensure that bounding boxes are tightly fitted around the signs and do not include extraneous background.
                   - Multiple annotators may review each image to ensure accuracy and consistency.
                
                <dd>5. Quality Assurance</dd>
                   - Implement a quality assurance process where a separate team of reviewers checks the annotations for accuracy and consistency.
                   - Use inter-annotator agreement metrics to measure consistency between different annotators.
                   - Correct any errors or discrepancies identified during the review process.
                
                <dd>6. Data Augmentation</dd>
                   - Perform data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the dataset, such as rotating, flipping, scaling, and adjusting the brightness of the images.
                   - Ensure that augmented images are also correctly annotated.
                
                <dd>7. Dataset Preparation</dd>
                   - Organize the annotated images into a structured format (e.g., COCO format or Pascal VOC format).
                   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the performance of the model accurately.
                
                <dd>8. Model Training and Evaluation</dd>
                   - Use the annotated dataset to train a traffic sign recognition model (e.g., using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch).
                   - Evaluate the model's performance on the validation and test sets to ensure it accurately recognizes and classifies traffic signs.
                
                <dt>Example Annotation Guidelines:</dt>
                - Bounding Box Criteria:
                  - The bounding box should tightly fit the traffic sign, leaving minimal space around the edges.
                  - Overlapping signs should have separate bounding boxes.
                
                - Labeling Criteria:
                  - Each traffic sign should be labeled according to its category (e.g., "stop_sign," "yield_sign," "speed_limit_30," "pedestrian_crossing").
                  - Use consistent naming conventions for labels.
                
                - Quality Check:
                  - Review 10% of the annotated images for accuracy.
                  - Use feedback loops to provide annotators with corrections and tips for improvement.
                
                -Tools and resources
                - Annotation Tools: LabelImg, CVAT, VIA
                - Public Datasets: GTSRB, LISA Traffic Sign Dataset

                   - Collect text reviews from various sources, such as e-commerce websites, social media platforms, and review websites.
                   - Ensure a diverse dataset by including reviews from different product categories, services, and industries.
                
                <dd>2. Define Annotation Guidelines:</dd>
                   - Create a detailed annotation guide that specifies how to annotate the sentiment of each review.
                   - Define sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) and provide examples for each category.
                   - Include rules for handling ambiguous or mixed sentiments.
                
                <dd>3. Annotation Tool Selection:</dd>
                   - Choose an annotation tool that supports text annotation, such as Doccano, Prodigy, or Labelbox.
                
                <dd>4. Annotation Process:</dd>
                   - Annotators will read each review and label it with the appropriate sentiment category.
                   - Ensure consistent labeling by following the predefined guidelines.
                   - Allow annotators to flag reviews that are difficult to classify or require further discussion.
                
                <dd>5. Quality Assurance:</dd>
                   - Implement a quality assurance process where a separate team of reviewers checks the annotations for accuracy and consistency.
                   - Use inter-annotator agreement metrics (e.g., Cohen's kappa) to measure consistency between different annotators.
                   - Correct any errors or discrepancies identified during the review process.
                
                <dd>6. Data Augmentation:</dd>
                   - Perform data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the dataset, such as paraphrasing, synonym replacement, and sentence shuffling.
                   - Ensure that augmented texts are also correctly annotated.
                
                <dd>7. Dataset Preparation:</dd>
                   - Organize the annotated texts into a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
                   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the performance of the model accurately.
                
                <dd>8. Model Training and Evaluation:</dd>
                   - Use the annotated dataset to train a sentiment analysis model (e.g., using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or transformers like BERT).
                   - Evaluate the model’s performance on the validation and test sets to ensure it accurately classifies sentiments.
                
                <dd>Example Annotation Guidelines:</dd>
                - Sentiment Categories:
                  - Positive: Reviews that express satisfaction or positive experiences (e.g., "I love this product!").
                  - Negative: Reviews that express dissatisfaction or negative experiences (e.g., "This product is terrible.").
                  - Neutral: Reviews that are neither positive nor negative or express mixed sentiments (e.g., "The product is okay, not great but not bad either.").
                
                <dd>- Ambiguous Cases:</dd>
                  - If a review contains both positive and negative sentiments, classify it based on the overall sentiment expressed.
                  - Flag reviews that are too ambiguous to classify definitively.
                
                <dd>- Quality Check:</dd>
                  - Review 10% of the annotated reviews for accuracy.
